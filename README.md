# zig-monkey

This is a zig implementation of the intepreter of the Monkey language, see: https://interpreterbook.com/


This is not meant to be used for any serious work, it is just an exercise for me to gain familiarity with the zig language and interpreters.
With that being said, if you come by this repo and have some suggestions, expecially related to how something should be done the "zig way", feel free to drop them.
